### Hi there üëã
Hi, I'm Daniel! 
Founded in 1986, I'm a software developer at heart, and really love to build stuff. I love it even more if it benefits others.

Most of the stuff I build in my spare time is available for free.
Besides writing consumer applications, I'm also interested in game programming, music, video editing and more. ü•≥
